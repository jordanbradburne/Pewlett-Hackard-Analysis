# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to...
  1. Determine the number of retiring employees per title
  2. Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 
  3. Write a report that summarizes the analysis as well as helps prepare our friend's manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results: 
1. Number of retiring employees per title

* The number of retirement-age employees by most recent job title is shown below:
